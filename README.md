KSword is an ARK (Anti-Rootkit) and system analysis toolkit for Windows 10/11 x64. It ships a desktop app and a kernel driver together — the app enumerates processes, drivers, connections, etc. from user mode, the driver does the same from Ring 0, and then they compare. Discrepancies mean something is hiding.

On top of that, there is a full set of system tools: memory search & hex editing, PE/ELF/Mach-O scanning, packet capture, raw NTFS forensics, SSDT/callback/hook inspection, registry & startup auditing, device-stack tracing, and security policy checks — roughly what you'd otherwise piece together from ten different programs.

All audit pages are read-only by default. Anything that modifies the system (driver unload, disk write, protection-level change, etc.) is behind a separate button with a confirmation dialog and undo where possible. When a kernel offset or feature isn't available on the current build, the UI says so instead of guessing.

Source-available under the [KSword Community Source License v1.6](LICENSE) (not OSI-approved — see [License](#license)).

Want to contribute? Start with the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), [developer setup](docs/development.md), and [documentation index](docs/README.md). Primary guides have English and Chinese versions.

## Quick Start

Extract the release archive, run `Launcher.exe` as admin. It reads the support manifest and starts the right edition.

`KswordSetup.exe` is an optional installer that does the same thing plus creates shortcuts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> R0 features need the KswordARK driver loaded. Without it the app still works, but kernel-side pages will show "unavailable."

## Two Editions

|  | Ksword5.1 | KswordARKLight |
|---|---|---|
| Stack | Qt 6 / ADS dockable workspace | Native Win32, no runtime dependencies |
| Use case | Full workflow | Old machines, quick triage, minimal footprint |

Both use the same driver and the same `shared/driver/` protocol. Launcher picks for you.

## Features

**Process / Thread / Handle** — tree & list views, R3/R0 cross-view to detect hidden objects, thread stacks, modules, tokens, PDB diagnostics. Gated actions for kill, suspend, R0 hide (recoverable), PPL patch.

**Memory** — region browser, pattern search, hex viewer, bookmarks, R0 reads, kernel executable-memory scan, PTE translation. Every memory page can also run against a **DDMA** backend that moves bytes with the disk controller's bus-master DMA instead of the CPU, plus a same-address cross-check between the two backends. Lab use only; see below for what it costs.

<details>
<summary>DDMA — reading physical memory through the disk controller (and its three unavoidable costs)</summary>

<br>

DDMA issues a `_DIRECT` pass-through command against a `\Driver\Disk` device with
the transfer buffer pointed at an arbitrary physical page — `ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT`
where ATA is available, otherwise `SCSI_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT`, which covers NVMe,
SAS/SATA and synthetic SCSI. Either way the storage port driver builds the MDL and
programs the controller, so the *host bus adapter* moves the bytes. The data path never goes through the CPU page tables,
so it is not constrained by SLAT/EPT — which is the whole point: a page that a
hypervisor redirects reads to all-`FF` still yields its real contents here. The
DDMA sub-tab reads the same physical page through both backends and diffs them,
which turns "this page is hidden" into a byte-level observation.

Technique credit: [btbd/ddma](https://github.com/btbd/ddma).

Three costs, none of which can be engineered away:

1. **It must borrow a disk sector as a staging area.** ATA only has read-sector
   and write-sector, so reading a physical page means writing it to a sector and
   reading it back. KSword requires you to name that LBA explicitly and tick an
   acknowledgement — there is **no default sector**, and the "is the LBA set?"
   test is a separate flag bit rather than "is it non-zero", because LBA 0 is a
   legal target and is also where the MBR lives. Each request backs the sectors
   up, uses them, and restores them inside one call; a failed restore is reported
   as an explicit warning rather than swallowed.
2. **Kernel debugging must be off.** Mapping ordinary RAM with `MmMapIoSpace`
   trips `MiShowBadMapper` and bugchecks. The driver reports the debugger state
   as a capability bit and the UI refuses the whole channel when it is set.
3. **The disk's driver stack has to accept a pass-through command.** ATA
   pass-through is tried first; if it is refused, SCSI pass-through is tried,
   which `stornvme` translates into NVMe commands — so NVMe, SAS/SATA and
   synthetic SCSI all work through that second route. A disk that refuses both
   cannot be used, and some HBAs cannot address above 4 GB. Note that the
   SLAT-bypass property itself only exists where the OS owns real hardware: in a
   hypervisor *guest* the "DMA" is emulated by the host and goes through the same
   address translation as everything else.

Non-full-page writes are read-modify-write and are reported as such, because
they leave a 4 KiB lost-update window for other bytes on the same page.

`KswordCLI.exe ddma selftest [--lba N]` runs the acceptance checks. Every check
is a refusal path, so it never writes a sector.

</details>

**Scanner** — structural PE / ELF / Mach-O analysis. Byte editor is length-preserving only, checks the source snapshot before writing, atomic replace, optional backup.

**Network** — capture & filter, connection management, per-process throttle, request builder, HTTPS inspection, WFP firewall, NIDS, segmented download. R0 inventories: TCP / UDP / AFD / NSI / NDIS / WFP.

**Driver / Kernel** — service management, DriverObject / DeviceObject / MajorFunction inspection, transactional dispatch-table editor, loader-list removal (reversible), integrity & cross-view checks, unloaded-driver / PiDDB evidence. Object namespace, SSDT/SSSDT, IAT/EAT/inline hooks, callbacks (notify, registry, object, filter, bugcheck, shutdown, FS, logon, NMI, …), IDT baselines, descriptor-table & IOCTL decoding, disassembly.

**File / Storage** — dual-pane manager, hashes, signatures, PE/strings/hex, unlocker, NTFS recovery, minifilter & Section evidence, raw filesystem browser with deleted-entry analysis (read-only by default, write requires unlock), device tree and R0 device-stack audit.

**Monitor** — per-process ETW, syscall capture, WinAPI agent, WMI subscriptions, ETW session management, risk center. Task-Manager-style live charts.

**Window / Registry / Handle / Startup / Service / Privilege** — what you'd expect, plus Win32k GUI audit, startup-item risk gating with recovery, and service TSV/JSON export.

**Security** — AppLocker, WDAC, Defender/ASR, VBS/Hyper-V, driver trust, event logs.

**Kernel Knowledge** — 71 bilingual searchable articles, each linked to live R3/R0 evidence pages.

**HVM** — VMX self-test, one-shot guest, guarded Intel VT-x/EPT resident monitor, multiprocessor-capable. EPT split views (execute-only shadow pages) served by an EPTP-switching backend, so hooks work on nested hypervisors that expose no monitor-trap flag. Guided EPT-hook wizard. Refuses on AMD or incompatible config. Lab use only.

<details>
<summary>Where the HVM layer sits (and what "resident" means)</summary>

<br>

KSword HVM does **not** boot a second Windows. It performs a late virtualization
transition on the OS that is already running: after `VMLAUNCH` the original
execution context continues unchanged in VMX non-root, while KSword HVM services
its VM exits from VMX root. Nothing restarts; nothing visibly happens.

```

On bare metal the `Hyper-V (L0)` layer is simply absent and KSword HVM is L0
itself. Either way it is the **same** OS above and below the transition.

**Resident** is the mode in which that layer exists at all. A one-shot guest only
proves VMX can be entered and left; residency puts the running Windows into
non-root and keeps it there. Stop residency and every EPT-based capability —
covert hooks, split views, execution domains, R-1 process dispositions — stops
existing at the same instant, because the hardware is no longer consulting our
EPT. That is also why installing any of them requires residency to be stopped
first, and why `sc stop` returns 1052 while it is running.

## Building

Start with the offline tests or CLI. On Windows, install Visual Studio 2022's
Desktop development with C++ workload (MSVC v143 and Windows SDK), then run:

```powershell
uv run --python 3.12 python tools/dev.py doctor
uv run --python 3.12 python tools/dev.py test
uv run --python 3.12 python tools/dev.py test --target cli
```

These targets need no Qt, WDK, driver, or private release data. Python 3.12+
users can replace `uv run --python 3.12 python` with `python`.
For the Qt desktop, dependency discovery, build troubleshooting, and the inputs
required by apps/launcher/ARKLight, see the [build guide](docs/development.md).

## Contributing

Bug reports, docs, translations, tests, and code contributions are welcome in
English or Chinese. The [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) walks through a
first PR and lists small, independently testable areas. The
[code map](docs/maintenance.md) explains where changes belong.

Run `python tools/check.py` for the source checks used by CI (Python 3.12+, no Qt
or WDK needed). Build and test the affected component before submitting a change.

## Next

**Hvm & Nested VM** — the resident monitor runs multiprocessor under nested
Hyper-V, with CLOAK split views verified end-to-end on 2 vCPU. Cross-core TLB
invalidation, which a forwarded flush hypercall silently drops in that
environment, is fixed and measured
([writeup](docs/next/嵌套下的跨核TLB失效.md)).

Two optimizations were evaluated and **declined**, with the readings kept so the
decision can be revisited on different hardware rather than re-argued:

- *Enlightened VMCS.* A `VMREAD` costs 0.14% of one exit here — measured by
  adding a known number of throwaway reads per exit and watching throughput, at
  three depths spanning 16x, agreeing to ±0.003. At ~10 field reads per exit
  that caps the win at **1.4%**, against a ~150-entry mapping table and the loss
  of three fields the enlightened layout does not carry. The outer hypervisor
  turns out to run VMCS shadowing, so the premise this optimization rests on —
  that a nested `VMREAD` traps — does not hold on this machine. The probe is
  kept (`hvm_ctl resident-vmreadbench <n>`); one command re-decides it elsewhere.
- *VPID.* Enabling it would stop VM entry from flushing the linear mappings
  tagged VPID 0000H, which is precisely what makes the cross-core flush fix
  work — it would fail **silently**, back to the 97% figure above. The cost is
  concrete and the benefit is unmeasured, so it stays paired with that fix
  rather than taken alone.

Genuinely open: nested VMX. The vmcs12→vmcs02 merge path exists and runs on
every L2 entry attempt, but two-dimensional page-table composition does not, so
every attempt ends in `VMfailValid` (and is counted, not silently dropped).
Largest real exit cost is HLT at 62%, which the outer hypervisor forces through
the capability MSR and we cannot decline.

**Anti BSOD**
