; Launch L2 so that it resumes where L1's registers already belong.
;
; The probe's earlier attempt pointed vmcs12's guest RIP at an RtlCaptureContext

; registers as of L1's VMLAUNCH - a different point in the same function - so

; registers and stack intact, because they were never disturbed.
;

;
; Re-issue the guest's VMCALL from VMX root so the hypervisor above us answers
; it.  The guest here IS the Windows that was running before residency began,
; so its hypercall page, its SynIC and its synthetic MSRs are all owned by that
; outer hypervisor; refusing the call with #UD bugchecks the machine the moment
; storvsc sends its first VMBus packet (observed: 0x1E / c000001d with
; winhv!WinHvpFastHypercall on the stack).
;
; Under nested virtualization the processor is physically in the outer
; hypervisor's non-root operation even while we believe we are in root, so
; VMCALL exits to it exactly as it would from the guest.
;
; Returns 0 when the call was answered and 1 when nothing serviced it.  The
; check is a sentinel in RAX rather than the carry and zero flags: VMCALL never
; writes RAX on any outcome - neither a VM exit nor a VMfail does - while the
; Hyper-V x64 ABI leaves the input value of RAX undefined and returns the status
; there, so overwriting it costs nothing and an unchanged sentinel is
; unambiguous.  The flags cannot serve the same purpose because nothing
; promises a hypercall preserves guest RFLAGS.  Without this the caller cannot
; distinguish "answered" from "silently ignored", and CPUID reporting a
; hypervisor is not proof that one answers VMCALL - the guest would then be
; handed back its own pre-call RAX as a hypercall status and advanced past the
; instruction, on the storvsc and VMBus paths.  That is worse than a bugcheck.
;
; Hyper-V x64 hypercall ABI: RCX carries the control word, RDX and R8 carry the
; input and output (a GPA for slow calls, the operands themselves for fast
; ones), the result comes back in RAX, and extended fast calls pass further
; operands in XMM0-XMM5.  Only those six are moved, and with MOVAPS rather than
; FXRSTOR64: XMM6-XMM15 are non-volatile in the Windows x64 calling convention,
; so restoring the whole area would clobber registers the C dispatcher is
; entitled to find intact, and it would also load the guest's MXCSR underneath
; every subsequent instruction executed in root operation.  Legacy SSE stores
; leave the upper YMM and ZMM halves alone, which matches what the surrounding
; FXSAVE64 design already assumes.
;
; Six XMM registers is the whole of it, not a truncation.  TLFS states that the
; XMM fast hypercall interface uses six XMM registers to pass an input parameter
; block of up to 112 bytes, and both the input-only and the input-and-output
; register maps list exactly RCX, RDX, R8 and XMM0 through XMM5.  The arithmetic
; closes: XMM0-5 is 96 bytes plus RDX and R8 is 112.  A third-party
; implementation documents that it cannot forward extended fast hypercalls
; because its exit stub snapshots XMM0-5 and only restores them before resuming
; the guest, leaving the wrong values in the registers at the moment of
; forwarding.  Loading them from the saved area first, as below, is what closes
; that gap - keep it.
;
; One known and deliberate omission: TLFS says a rep hypercall also modifies RCX
; with the new rep start index, and the frame's RCX is not written back below.
; It is narrower than it sounds, because a continuation returns without advancing
; the instruction pointer past the invoking instruction - here that instruction
; is this stub's own VMCALL, so the continuation is absorbed by re-execution
; inside the stub with the updated value already in the register, never passing
; through the frame.  The reps-completed field returned in RAX is an absolute
; count rather than one relative to the start index, so a guest loop terminating
; on it converges regardless.  Changing this is a separate commit with its own
; soak, and the real hazard on this path is a different one: that absorption
; loop spins in VMX root with interrupts disabled.
