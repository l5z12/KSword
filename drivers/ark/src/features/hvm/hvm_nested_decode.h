Module Name:

    hvm_nested_decode.h

Abstract:

    Decodes the VM-exit instruction-information field into the operand that a
    VMX instruction named.  Every nested VMX instruction except VMXOFF,
    VMLAUNCH and VMRESUME carries an operand, so this decode is the shared
    prerequisite for all of them.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework.

 * Intel gives VMREAD and VMWRITE a different field layout from the rest: they
 * can name a register instead of memory, and they spend bits 6:3 and 31:28 on
 * the two register operands that the memory-only instructions leave undefined.
 * Decoding one with the other's layout reads undefined bits as if they meant
 * something, so the caller states which one it has.

 * separate layout rather than always reading those bits, because reading

 *
 * These are the VM-exit-safe accessors.  kswordArkHvmMemoryTranslate is not
 * one: it reads page-table entries through a shared window guarded by
 * KeAcquireSpinLock, and taking a spin lock in VMX root means either an IRQL
 * claim we cannot honour or a wait on a processor that may itself be in root
 * mode.  That module belongs to the IOCTL path.
 *
 * Window is the calling processor's physical window.  It is not optional in
 * practice - without one there is no way to resolve the address and the call
 * refuses - but it is typed optional because the resident context is allowed
 * to come up without a window, and a caller that lost the race must get a
 * refusal rather than a fault.
 *
 * The address is resolved through the **guest's** page tables, not by
 * dereferencing it.  A guest that runs its own address space - which is what
 * every hypervisor underneath us does - has kernel-half addresses that exist
 * in no Windows address space, and dereferencing one from root mode is a
 * bugcheck.  That is not hypothetical; see the walk's own comment.
