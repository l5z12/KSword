/*++

Module Name:

    hvm_nested.c

Abstract:

    Implements a bounded vmcs12 state machine and explicit partial dispatch for
    VMX instructions.  L2 entry and shadow EPT are rejected with architectural
    VMfail semantics until their complete merge and invalidation paths exist.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework.

 * VMCS.  We intercept every VMWRITE and keep the fields in our own storage
 * instead, which is correct for every operation that names the VMCS - and
 * wrong for every operation that names the *page*.
 *
 * Measured need: VMware configures a VMCS at one physical address, and then
 * switches to a second one and launches it after writing nothing but guest
 * state into it - the same VMPTRLD instruction, the same operand slot, a
 * different pointer.  Its controls, host state and EPT pointer never arrive,
 * so L2 enters with our own identity EPT and a real-mode guest fetches from
 * the wrong memory.  A hypervisor may legitimately move a VMCS's backing page
 * and expect the contents to move with it; ours stayed behind because they
 * were keyed to an address rather than stored in the page.
 *
 * So the region becomes the backing store and the pool stays a cache: spilled
 * whenever the working copy stops being current, reloaded when a pointer is
 * new to the pool.  Written as (encoding, value) pairs rather than a fixed
 * field map, so no per-field capacity table has to stay in step with the
 * architecture, and only fields L1 actually set take space.
 *
 * The first eight bytes are never touched: they are L1's VMCS revision
 * identifier and its VMX-abort indicator, and both belong to L1.
