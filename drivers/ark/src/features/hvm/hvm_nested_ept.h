Module Name:

    hvm_nested_ept.h

Abstract:

    Defines the shadow EPT that composes L1's EPT12 with our own EPT01 so the
    processor, which only walks one hierarchy, can run L2.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework.

 * Bound the table pages one processor's shadow hierarchy may consume.

 * Filling happens inside a VM exit, where allocation is not available, so
 * every table page has to exist before L2 starts.  The count covers a root
 * plus the interior tables an L2 working set touches; exhaustion is reported
 * as a denied violation rather than a crash, because the alternative to
 * "L2 cannot run this page" must not be "the host stops".

     * address inside RAM that this code refused thirty-five thousand times,
     * and the reading said only "refused".
     *
     *   Site  1 the EPT12 walk found no mapping (Level and Entry say where)
     *         2 EPT12 maps it, but grants less than the access needs
     *         3 our own EPT01 leaf narrows it below the access
     *         4 no table page left to compose with
     *         5 an interior entry named a page we never handed out
     */
    /*
     * Whether a composed mapping still says what EPT12 says.
     *
     * This is the one failure that can end in a triple fault while leaving no
     * exit behind.  A shadow leaf naming a frame EPT12 did not means the
     * guest's own page-table walk reads another page's bytes, and every fault
     * after that - #PF, #DF, the shutdown - happens inside the guest, where
     * nothing here can see it.  Measured symptom it exists to explain: L1's
     * processor triple-faults while delivering its own local-timer vector into
     * an interruptible 64-bit guest, with no exception exit anywhere near.
     *
     * Sampled rather than checked on every fill, because the check is a second
     * EPT12 walk through the physical window and fills run into six figures per
     * boot.  One GPA is held back from each sample and verified at the next
     * one, so what is being tested is a mapping that has had time to go stale -
     * checking a leaf against the walk that just produced it would prove only
     * that the assignment worked.
     *
     * Unresolved is kept apart from mismatched: a hierarchy that no longer
     * describes the address was dropped by an invalidation, which is correct
     * behaviour and not a defect.
