     * makes someone ask which of the two is authoritative.

     *   page, which is where L1 will look for them;
     *
     *   exit MSR-LOAD (0x2008) loads *host* MSRs after the exit - and the host
     *   is us, not L1.  Copying L1's list there would have the processor load
     *   L1's host values into our root context on every single L2 exit, which
     *   is a way to lose the machine rather than a missing feature.  This
     *   version therefore drops it; servicing it correctly means applying that
     *   list while reflecting the exit to L1, in the reflection path, where
     *   "L1's host state" is the thing being restored anyway.

/*
 * Deliver again the event whose delivery this exit interrupted.
 *
 * A VM exit can happen while the processor is still delivering an event - it
 * is reading the IDT or pushing the fault frame when the access faults.  The
 * event is then *not* delivered, and the processor says so in the
 * IDT-vectoring information field.  Whoever handles the exit is the one that
 * has to deliver it again; nothing else in the machine remembers it.
 *
 * Only the exits this driver answers itself need this.  A reflected exit
 * carries the field into vmcs12 and L1 does the re-delivery, which is what
 * real hardware would report to it.  An exit we resolve and resume from has no
 * L1 in the loop at all - and that is the overwhelming majority: composing a
 * shadow EPT leaf resolves 99% of L2's exits, and a cold shadow hierarchy
 * faults exactly where event delivery touches memory.
 *
 * What it cost to not do this: L1 acknowledges its virtual interrupt
 * controller *before* asking for the injection, so an event destroyed here is
 * an interrupt already taken off the controller with no handler and therefore
 * no EOI.  An 8259 will not assert INTR again while an interrupt of the same
 * or lower priority is in service, and IRQ 0 is the highest priority there
 * is.  Measured in the guest: ISR stuck at 0x03, IRR stuck at 0x41, BIOS tick
 * frozen for the entire run, zero injections requested in a 40-second window
 * because from L1's side there was nothing left to ask for.  Two lost
 * interrupts, early, and the machine never took another one.
 *
 * Not done here: merging a fault that arrived during delivery into #DF.  That
 * rule applies to an exception raised while delivering another exception, and
 * exception exits are L1's - they never reach this path.  If that routing ever
 * changes, this is the second half that has to come with it.
