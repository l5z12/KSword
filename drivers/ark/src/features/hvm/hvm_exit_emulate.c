Module Name:

    hvm_exit_emulate.c

Abstract:

    Emulates the VM exits a resident guest cannot avoid.  Enabling the MSR
    bitmap removes the RDMSR/WRMSR exit storm, which leaves INVD, XSETBV and
    out-of-bitmap MSR access as the only unconditional exits the dispatcher
    must complete instead of devirtualizing.  Every routine here runs in VMX
    root on the processor-owned host stack: no allocation, no waiting, and no
    instruction that can fault without an architecturally verified operand.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework, VMX root operation.
