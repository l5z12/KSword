Module Name:

    hvm_nested_bitmap.c

Abstract:

    Implements the MSR and I/O bitmap merge for L2, and the ownership tests the
    exit path uses to decide whether L1 armed a given MSR or port exit.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework.

         * that does not arm it - or a future narrowing of what we intercept -
         * gets the fast path back without anyone having to rediscover it.
         *

         * running L2 against a stale one until the next merge. Pointing at the
         * same page means the processor sees the edit immediately.
         *
         * Valid because EPT01 is an identity map, so an L1 physical address is
         * a host physical address.  The walk in hvm_nested_ept.c already
         * depends on exactly this; if that ever stops holding, both break
         * together rather than one silently.
         *
