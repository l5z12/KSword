# Run the portable EPT suites, then measure what they can actually detect.
#
# A suite that passes tells you nothing on its own: it may be asserting only what
# the implementation already does. This harness injects a defect into a *copy* of
# each header and requires the suite to fail. The repository copies are never
# modified.
#
# Each mutation is also run against the suite as committed, so added coverage is
# reported as a number rather than asserted. Mutations both versions kill are not
# evidence for new cases. A suite with no committed baseline reports "new".
#
# Usage: tools/hvm_paper/Test-EptLeaseMutation.sh [output-directory]
# Needs cc/gcc and git. Writes ept-lease-unit.txt and ept-lease-mutation.txt.
