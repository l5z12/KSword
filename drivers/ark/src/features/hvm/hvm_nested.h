 * How many vmcs12 one processor can hold besides the loaded one.
 *
 * A slot is the full field array, about 16 KiB, so this is roughly 128 KiB per
 * processor that actually runs an L2.  Eight covers a hypervisor with a
 * handful of vCPUs plus its own housekeeping VMCSs; beyond that the eviction
 * counter says so rather than the behaviour quietly degrading back to the
 * single-vmcs12 failure this replaces.

/*
 * Hold vmcs12 contents where they outlive one processor's VMX operation.
 *
 * Shared by every processor, because a VMCS is a region of memory and not a
 * per-processor object.  Intel requires VMCLEAR on the processor that holds a
 * VMCS current before VMPTRLD of the same region elsewhere, and that pair is
 * exactly how a hypervisor moves a vCPU between host processors - so a
 * per-processor store loses the whole configuration on the first migration
 * while every counter still reads healthy.
 *
 * Measured, not reasoned about: VMware's VMCS at 0x7e6f000 held thirty-six
 * fields in processor 1's store and six in processor 0's at the same instant.
 * The launch it eventually issued ran on processor 0 and carried none of the
 * controls it had configured, and the entry failed on guest state.
 *
 * A slot may be accessed concurrently only while two processors race to claim
 * a free one; the fields themselves cannot be, because the architecture lets
 * one VMCS be current on one processor at a time.  So the claim is interlocked
 * and the copies are plain.
