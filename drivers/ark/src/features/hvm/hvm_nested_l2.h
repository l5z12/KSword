Module Name:

    hvm_nested_l2.h

Abstract:

    Defines L2 entry from vmcs12 and the routing of L2 exits between us and L1.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework.

 * Ours, and still needing the ordinary handling to run on vmcs02.

 * Distinct from HANDLED, and the distinction is load-bearing in both
 * directions.  A shadow-resolved EPT violation is finished: resuming
 * re-executes the access and it now succeeds, while letting the ordinary
 * handling run would evaluate an L2 guest-physical against our own hierarchy,
 * which does not describe it.  An MSR or port access is the opposite: nothing
 * has serviced it, so resuming re-executes the same instruction against the
 * same interception forever - RIP never advanced because nobody emulated
 * anything.
 *
 * Collapsing the two into HANDLED costs a hang with no error anywhere; into
