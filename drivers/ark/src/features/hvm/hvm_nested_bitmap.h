/*++

Module Name:

    hvm_nested_bitmap.h

Abstract:

    Builds the MSR and I/O bitmaps vmcs02 runs L2 under, and answers which of
    the two hypervisors asked for a given MSR or port exit.

Environment:

    Kernel-mode Driver Framework.

/*
 * Build this processor's L2 bitmaps from vmcs12 and our own.
 *
 * VM-exit safe: reads L1's pages through the per-processor physical window and
 * allocates nothing.  Call once per L2 entry, before vmcs02 is written.
 *
 * An MSR exits if either hypervisor wants it, so the MSR page is a union.  The
 * I/O pages are plain copies of L1's, because we request no I/O exiting and
 * therefore have nothing to add.
 *
 * When L1 did not ask for MSR filtering at all, the merged page is left at
 * all-ones: architecturally every L2 MSR access then belongs to L1, and
 * all-ones plus reflection reproduces exactly that.  The same conservative
 * direction covers a page we could not read - `Complete` goes false and the
 * bitmap keeps intercepting everything rather than silently letting L2 through.
