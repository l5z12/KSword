/*
 * Address vmcs12 storage by field encoding instead of searching for it.
 *
 * The key is (width, type, index) - all three.  Width is not decoration:
 * Intel reuses the same index within the same type across widths, so
 *
 *     0x0800  ES selector          width 0 (16-bit), type 2, index 0
 *     0x6800  guest CR0            width 3 (natural), type 2, index 0
 *
 * collide on any key that leaves width out.  A key of (type, index) alone
 * makes every segment selector and its same-index control register share one
 * slot, so each write destroys the other - and the only symptom is a VM entry
 * that fails on guest state with no indication which field.  Measured, not
 * reasoned about: that is exactly what the first L2 launch reported.
 *
 * The previous sparse 64-entry cache searched linearly and had its own
 * problems: a real vmcs12 has well over a hundred fields, so L1 would fill it
 * part-way through configuring its VMCS and start receiving
 * unsupported-component errors - which L1 does not treat as fatal, so it would
 * carry on to VMLAUNCH holding a control state we silently truncated.
 *
 * Access type (bit 0) is deliberately not part of the key: it selects the high
 * half of a 64-bit field, which is the same storage.
 *
 * Index is bounded to 128 rather than the encodable 512.  The highest index
 * any defined field uses is far below that, and an encoding above it is
 * reported as an unsupported component - which is the truthful answer, since
 * this model genuinely does not address it.
